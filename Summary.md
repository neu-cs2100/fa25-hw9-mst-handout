## Defining distance

In this assignment, we defined the weight of the edge between two nodes as the
geographical distance between the two stations.

What if we defined the edge weight some other way? For example, we could say,
"the Fruitvale BART is 15 minutes from here," and that would be a meaningful
weight. In that case, we would be defining the edge weight as the
number of minutes it takes to travel between the two nodes.

Let's discuss the pros and cons of various definitions of the edge weight.

Let's pretend that we are going to use these new edge weights to
build a new MST, keeping the stations where they are, and replace the
existing BART train tracks with the new tracks from the new MST.

### Practicality [4 points]

We could define the edge weight between two stations as the financial cost of
building the track between them (which is bigger if we have to dig a tunnel
underwater or through a mountain).

_Ethically, what are the pros and cons of using money as the edge weights to
build an MST to choose BART tracks?_

### Privacy [4 points]

We could define the edge weight as 1/n, where n is the number of passengers who
regularly travel between the two stations. To count the number of passengers
who travel between two stations, we need to keep track of each passenger's
entrance and exit station. This would require asking the Clipper Card company
to give us the entrance and exit locations for each passenger.

_How could we protect people's privacy while still using that data?_

### Fairness [4 points]

Traveling by BART costs different amounts of money, depending on
how far you're going. Additionally, passengers with low incomes can
receive discounted tickets.

What if we defined the edge weight between two stations as 1/n, where n
is the revenue from ticket sales from passengers travelling between
those two stations?

_How would you ensure that BART still services all communities, including
those with less money?_

### Climate change [4 points]

We want to reduce traffic congestion and greenhouse gas emissions from cars
driving on the roads. Let's assume that car drivers will switch to BART if BART
is more convenient than driving.

_What definition could we use for the edge weights such that the MST will
select a system of BART tracks that would reduce the number of cars on the
road?_

## Logistics

### What was the summary sentence output by the program for all stations? [1 point]

It should be of the form `The minimum spanning tree has __ edges and is __ miles long.`

### How many hours do you estimate the assignment took? [1 point]

_Rather than giving a range, if you are unsure, give the averages of the range._

### Who did you work with and how? [1 point]


### What other resources did you use? [1 point]

_Please give specific URLs (not just "Stack Overflow" or "Baeldung") and
state which ones were particularly helpful._

## Reflections [2 points]

Give **one or more paragraphs** reflecting on your experience with the
assignment, including answers to all of these questions:

* _What was the most difficult part of the assignment?_
* _What was the most rewarding part of the assignment?_
* _What did you learn doing the assignment?_

_Constructive and actionable suggestions for improving assignments, office
hours, and lecture are always welcome. If there was a TA who was especially
helpful, please share that._
